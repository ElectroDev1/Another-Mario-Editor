# Another-Mario-Editor

![AME logo](https://github.com/ElectroDev1/Another-Mario-Editor/blob/main/logo.png)

This is just a soft recreation of Super Mario Maker, similar to my attempt at making a soft
remake of Game Maker Garage.

This was just made for me to learn more about level editors and data structures.
**I'm not trying to make a mario maker fangame**, and I usually only add stuff to it during the weekends.

------------------------------------------------------

If you want a good Mario Maker fangame, please check out NinStar's project [Unimaker](https://github.com/ninstar/UniMaker), it has a lot more effort put into it!
Also check out [GateteVerde's](https://github.com/GateteVerde) Mario frameworks for Gamemaker, they're really well made, with one being worked on right now!

------------------------------------------------------

The project is completely open source and you can add to it if you can get though my bad code, I'll comment it more in the future for easier use!
There could be some problems related to editing entities and dragging, if you find any bugs please tell me 
using GitHub's Issues section.
