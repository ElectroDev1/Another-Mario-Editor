# Another-Mario-Editor

This is just a soft recreation of Super Mario Maker, similar to my attempt at making a soft
remake of Game Maker Garage.

This was just made for me to learn more about level editors and data structures
**I'm not trying to make a mario maker fangame**.

If you want a good Mario Maker fangame, please check out NinStar's project [Unimaker](https://github.com/ninstar/UniMaker), it has a lot more effort put into it!
Also check out [GateteVerde's](https://github.com/GateteVerde) Mario frameworks, they're really well made, with one being worked on right now!

There is code for a firebar object, but it's still in progress
There could be some problems related to editing entities and dragging, if you find any bugs please tell me 
using GitHub's Issues section
